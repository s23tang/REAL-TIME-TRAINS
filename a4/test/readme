OPERATION
---------

The program should be operated by loading the elf file and executing, namely

	1. load -b 0x00218000 -h 10.15.167.4 "ARM/wt/wtA2.elf"

	2. go

COMPILATION
-----------

The max number of tasks (mt) and number of priority queues (mp) will be
determined at compile time. Then the makefile will be executed by

	make mt=<max number of tasks> mp=<number of priority queues>

providing the appropriate numbers. The generated elf file can be copied over
to the tftp server to execute.


***NOTE
-------

The unix group permissions have been applied to the appropriate files.
